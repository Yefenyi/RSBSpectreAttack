Disable spectre protections in bootloader. Add the following to kernel parameters:
nospectre_v1 nospectre_v2 nospec_store_bypass_disable pr_spec_disable_noexec

Disable aslr:
echo 0 > sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

Both of these changes will be reverted on system reboot.

Disable ASLR for a specific program:
run "setarch `uname -m` --addr-no-randomize /bin/bash" to open a new shell.
Programs in this shell will not use ASLR.
